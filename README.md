# One Month Rails

This is my first attempt at making an application. I'm sure that in a month or so, I'll be laughing my ass off. At least I hope I will!

I'm trying to understand what the difference between an rdoc file and an md file is.  

here is an example of putting in a hyperlink (http://www.firebrandtech.com)

Here is the markdown commands from wikipedia, so I have them as a reference:

Heading 
=======

Sub-heading
-----------

Paragraphs are separated
by a blank line.

Text attributes *italic*,
**bold**, `monospace`.

A [link](http://example.com).

Shopping list:

  * apples
  * oranges
  * pears

Numbered list:

  1. apples
  2. oranges
  3. pears

The rain---not the reign---in
Spain.
